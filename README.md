• Implemented a Verilog-based real-time audio processing system, supporting multiple waveforms and dynamic user
interactions such as pause & skip functionality.

• Introduced a user-driven selection register with debounced button inputs, enabling seamless transitions between
various audio data sets stored in a nested case structure.

• Integrated a rising edge detector to handle user navigation and pausing, providing a user-friendly audio
demonstration on FPGA hardware.

• Utilized Vivado for synthesis and implementation, ensuring stable playback and reliable button input handling in a
real-time digital system.
